# Silent Failure in Express.js Server Due to Missing Async Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations within route handlers lack proper error handling. When an asynchronous operation fails, the server doesn't explicitly indicate an error; it silently continues running but might not respond correctly to requests.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install express` to install the necessary dependency.
4. Run `node bug.js` to execute the buggy code.
5. Observe that the server starts, but requests to the `/` route will not return the expected response.  The server will log an error to the console but won't report an error to the client.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with `bugSolution.js` to see the correct error handling.
